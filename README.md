The Online Lost and Found System is a web-based platform designed to help users report and find lost items easily. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a modern, responsive design with smooth animations powered by GSAP. Users can report lost or found items, search for missing belongings, and submit reports securely. The platform is ideal for campuses, offices, or public spaces, offering a practical solution to connect lost items with their owners. Future enhancements could include user accounts, notifications, and AI-based matching, making it even more efficient and user-friendly.
